/**
 * This header file defines the API for the AMCOM library that is responsible for sending and receiving AMCOM packets.
 *
 * Each AM packet consists of the following fields:
 *
 * +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
 * | SOP    | TYPE   | LENGTH | CRC             | PAYLOAD                                          |
 * | 1B     | 1B     | 1B     | 2B              | 0..200B                                          |
 * +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
 * <----- size of header is 5 bytes ----------->
 *
 * SOP (Start Of Packet) - indicates the start of new packet. One byte. Always 0xA1.
 * TYPE - byte defining the type of the packet. Valid values are from 0 to 255.
 * LENGTH - number of bytes in the payload. Can range from 0 to 200. 200 is the maximum packet payload length.
 * CRC - a two-byte field (uint16_t) containing the checksum of the packet. Encoding: little-endian (LSB first)
 *
